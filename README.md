Web Fundamentals

Goals

In this unit, you’ll:

Review and expand on the web development fundamentals you’ll need to succeed in any full-stack career
Learn how to use Chrome's native debugger to find and fix problems in your code
Learn about how timers work in JavaScript

Projects & Exercises:

In this unit, there are no projects to submit
At the end of the JavaScript Timers subunit, there will be an exercise on timers
 

The software engineering techniques we’ll teach you in this course build on web fundamentals like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. We want to make sure you understand the basics of these languages before we get into more advanced techniques. Depending on your knowledge level, this unit could be mostly review. Every page on the internet uses some combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - so once you learn how to use these languages effectively the possibilities are endless. Employers will want you to have knowledge of these languages - daily work will use these skills. 

After that, we'll teach you about how to use Chrome's Developer Tools to debug your code. Debugging skills are arguably the most important part of being an engineer.

This unit will also look at a JavaScript function called timers. This is a function that allows you to call a second function after a set amount of time elapses. For instance, if you wanted to create a pop up to collect the emails of visitors to your web page, a timer would be an easy way to schedule that. 

This is the start of Section I. All future units in Section I will build on these basics. For instance, in the unit after this on DOM Manipulation, you'll learn a method of interacting with HTML and CSS through JavaScript. You need to understand the basics we'll teach you here in order for this later material to make sense.
